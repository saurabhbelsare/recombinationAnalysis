# Recombination Analysis

These are my personal scripts to run specific recombination analyses. It contains the Snakefile and associated files to run the recombination analysis. This runs in a conda environment determined by environment.yml. There are multiple snakemake scripts and separate corresponding environments for each one.

The recombinationRate\_comparison\_scripts directory contains scripts for comparing recombination rates
